Running this executable presentation requires:

- sbt 0.12.3 or higher
- a clone of https://github.com/phaller/replhtml (branch `topic/play-keydown`)

Assuming `docs` and `replhtml` are siblings within the same base directory,
the presentation can be run as follows (from within the base directory of

    sbt -Dkeydown.root=$PWD/../docs/scala-tutorial run

Then, point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/`.
